# Basic Electronic Final Project


This project is designed to provide users with a sense of comfort by increasing or decreasing the humidity levels in their surrounding environment. The system involves five main components: an Arduino, a sensor, two actuators, a display, and a keypad. Below is a description of each component:

- **Keypad:** A numeric keypad will be used to set the critical humidity thresholds at which the humidifier or dehumidifier operates. It will also allow users to select the operating mode depending on the climatic conditions where it will be used.
- **Actuators:** Two actuators will be utilized:
  - **Fan:** Its purpose is to reduce the humidity in the environment of a given room.
  - **Humidifier:** Its function is to increase the humidity in the environment when the current level is below the required threshold.
- **Humidity Sensor:** This sensor detects humidity by taking real-time readings of the moisture level present in the room.
- **Arduino:** The Arduino will process the data from the humidity sensor and, based on the results, will activate the corresponding actuator. Additionally, the Arduino will allow users to manually operate any actuator depending on their needs.
- **Display:** This device will show the user the current humidity level in the environment and will also enable them to switch between manual and automatic operating modes as needed.
